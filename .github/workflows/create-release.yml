# Create Release Workflow
#
# This workflow automatically creates a GitHub Release after a version bump PR is merged.
# Uses reusable workflow from hope0hermes/SharedWorkflows for consistent CI/CD across projects.
#
# When it runs:
# - Automatically: When a PR with "chore: bump version to X.Y.Z" is merged to main
#
# What it does:
# 1. Detects version bump commits (format: "chore: bump version to X.Y.Z")
# 2. Extracts the version number from the commit message
# 3. Creates a GitHub Release with that version tag
# 4. Includes CHANGELOG content in the release notes
